                <p><em class="styleHistory">Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>influenced so many games that followed in different media and genres, but it has remained a vital product in its own right, appearing in diverse editions, media, and languages, as well as spinning off into literature, film, television, and the Internet. It has been a source of inspiration for artists of many kinds, but more importantly it has enriched the lives of tens of millions around the globe, offering a chance for anyone to experience fantastic roles and situations very different from everyday life. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, and the release of an eagerly-awaited new edition, this timeline shows some important dates in the development, elaboration, and the triumph of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.</p>
